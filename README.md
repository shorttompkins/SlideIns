2. Include slideins.js
3. During your page initialization ($(document).ready(...)) call SlideIns([delay],['easing']):
4. delay = 300ms by default
5. easing = 'swing' by default / (Can use any jqEasing setting if that file is included in your page.)
6. Be sure to use a wrapper element (container) and give it a class of "slidein_row"
7. Be sure that the element you want to SlideIn has a class of: "slidein_left", "slidein_middle", or "slidein_right"
